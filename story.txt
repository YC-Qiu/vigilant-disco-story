In a few weeks, the summer before his first year of high school, Alex joined the First Robotics
Competition (FRC) team at his new school and participated in the China Robotics Challenge. He was 
fascinated by the buzzy venue, the clicking sound of the gears and the roar of the motors. But when
he witnessed how powerless his team was compared to the other more experienced teams, he made up 
his mind to take the team further. In many ways this is the moment robotics becomes his biggest 
passion.
His idea was simple. He decided that he was going to become the greatest robotics maker ever.
Alex wanted to take his team to the next level so he devoted all of his time to
making robotics and becoming the best robotics maker ever. Eventually, he got to the point where all he was thinking about was robotics that he couldn't
do anything else. His whole life got turned upside down. His parents and teachers
all became very worried. One day in class there was an announcement over the PA
for him to come down to counselors office. He had no idea what this was about, but he
went anyway. When he got there the counselor told him to sit down. Then he said...

"Alex, I am becoming very concerned about you.  All you do is build robots and you have no friends."  Alex began to cry.  But then, he stopped.  "No, I have plenty of friends!  I'll show you!  You'll see!" He ran out of the room, determined to find a friend.  But other than his teammates, who didn't know him very well in the first place, he could not find any other friends.  "That's okay, " said Alex, "If I can't find any friends, I'll make one!"  He ran back home to begin work on his robot friend.

He built the first automated artificially intelligent robot called alexar. This was a remarkable discovery. He patented the discovery and became famous for the discovery. This discovery benefited humanity tremendously.
