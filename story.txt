In a few weeks, the summer before his first year of high school, Alex joined the First Robotics
Competition (FRC) team at his new school and participated in the China Robotics Challenge. He was 
fascinated by the buzzy venue, the clicking sound of the gears and the roar of the motors. But when
he witnessed how powerless his team was compared to the other more experienced teams, he made up 
his mind to take the team further. In many ways this is the moment robotics becomes his biggest 
passion.
